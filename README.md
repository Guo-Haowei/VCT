# Voxel GI

## Todo
- [ ] fix the voxel artifact
- [ ] stretch the triangle in geometry shader so there's fewer gaps in the voxelized scene
- [ ] shadow map (for a thing mesh, both sides will be rendered and a supposingly dark pixel will be illuminated)
- [x] visualize 3d texture
- [x] draw bbox to see if it's accurate
